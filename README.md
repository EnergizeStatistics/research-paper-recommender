# Content-Based Research Paper Recommender #
This repository hosts code for a rudimentary research paper recommender. 

## Description ##
The recommender aims at providing recommendations to researchers by using  their research interests, which are represented by their publications.

The code is for experimentation and demonstration purposes only; the recommender system is currently far from polished. Dataset used for the analysis is provided by [National University of Singapore](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sugiyama/SchPaperRecData.html). The data provider includes a detailed description on their webpage. Basically the dataset includes each researcherâ€™s most recent paper(s) (dataset has only 1 most recent paper for junior researchers but multiple for senior researchers) , 500+ candidate papers, and citation/reference relationship between papers. The data provider vectorized both types of papers. 

My content-based recommender focuses on the junior researchers. Cosine distance is used to measure article similarity. For now the analysis does not consider network - it is possible that the top recommendation is a paper that the researcher of interest did not lead (and therefore is not first author) but participated in the study. Including citation/reference relationship information in the picture could lead to the same it-recommends-my-own-study result. Figuring out which/how researchers are connected with others may provide us a remedy. 

Many possibilities exist for future work. I am most interested in adding the abovementioned network element to the analysis. Other similarity metrics can also be introduced. After experimenting with these techniques I will expand the analysis to the senior researchers.
